If you tell me more about the features you've added (like animation, custom sections, or libraries used), I can customize this README even more!

Let me know if youâ€™d like help with:
- pushing this to GitHub step-by-step
- generating a preview image for the README
- adding deploy buttons or shields (stars, forks, Netlify badge)

Want me to generate the `.gitignore` and LICENSE too?
